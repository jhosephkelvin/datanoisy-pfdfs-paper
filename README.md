An Exploratory Analysis of Data Noisy Scenarios in a Pareto-Front Based Dynamic Feature Selection Method

This repository is responsible for storing and making available the code of the datasets used in the article "An Exploratory Analysis of Data Noisy Scenarios in a Pareto-Front Based Dynamic Feature Selection Method" submitted to the journal Applied Soft Computing. It is important to emphasize that the datasets were generated by the Matlab tool, so it is required to use it to access them.

The "Datasets" folder contains three files referring to databases, namely:

1. Datasets_ASOC2020_Original.mat: Cell with the 15 original databases, with no artificial noise added, used in the paper.
2. Datasets_ASOC2020_Noise_IA.mat: Cell with 15 databases, with the insertion of artificial noise without changing the pre-existing features, used in the article. [Regarding Insertion Analysis / AI]
3. Datasets_ASOC2020_Noise_TA.mat: Cell with the 15 databases, with the transformation of the original features into noise, used in the paper. [Regarding Transformation Analysis / AT]
